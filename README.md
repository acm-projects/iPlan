Trying to plan an event can be hectic, messy, and hard to keep up with. iPlan helps you plan your event down to the finest details without the stress of having to look at multiple different places because everything is going to be compiled in one place, just a touch away.

  - Let users set deadlines in a calendar/timer and send custom notifications to remind them of the task
  - Plan the day of your event with an itinerary and make it shareable to other users
  - Collaborate with other users by adding them to your event module and assigning tasks
  
# Stretch Goals
  - Communicate with other users through a group chat feature 
  - Prioritize your tasks from highest to lowest importance as a checklist
  - Record the user's progress and provide suggestions on when to complete a task by to avoid stress
  - Send customized invites to your guest by adding them to a list and allowing them to RSVP
