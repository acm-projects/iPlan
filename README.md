Trying to plan an event can be hectic, messy, and hard to keep up with. iPlan helps you plan your event down to the finest details without the stress of having to look at multiple different places because everything is going to be compiled in one place, just a touch away.

# Milestones
Frontend AND Backend
  - Decide on tech stack
  - Download and set up environments
  - Spend 2 days at most researching what goes into an event and what is needed to plan one
  - Code test files in chosen language and upload to repository's test branch
  - COMMUNICATE! with each other and with project manager
  
* Frontend
  - Use Figma (preferred) or Adobe XD to draw up wireframes and edit until a finalized look is reached. Make wireframes interactive.
  - Learn basics of Flutter/Dart or React/Node.js
  - Code design from final wireframes
    * a home page with a list of sub-pages
    * add collaborators to event module
    * budget page
    * calendar page
    * itinerary page
  - combining frontend with backend 1) after each stage or 2) collectively integrate after front end is completely done with all pages
  
* Backend
  - Learn basics of Firebase/Node.js
  - Learn APIs 
    * Calendar API
    * Contact picker API
    * (possible) Notifications API
  - Set up database to store the information that user enters into each page
  - Integrate frontend and backend to display data that relies on database storage
  
# Tech Stack
  - **Wireframing**: Figma
  - **IDE**: Android Studio
  - **Frontend**: Flutter/React Native
    * Flutter provides a lot of built-in UI components and is easier for cross compatibility
    * React Native is more widely used in app development and also has great cross compatibility
  - **Backend**: Firebase/Node.js
      - Firebase handles flat data and simple queries very well, while firestore handles more complex data and advanced queries better
      - Node.js is high performance and has better scalability. 
      - Calendar API: [calendar api](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api)
      - Contact Picker API: [contact picker api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Contact_Picker_API)
      - Notifications API: [notifications api](https://docs.notificationapi.com/)
